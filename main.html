            <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
            <p>I was inspired to create this project when the powerball lottery was over a billion dollars. My sister and I got into a discussion about how it seems like there is a way to space your numbers in such a way that you are guarenteed to win. This is my attempt to prove this theory right.</p>
            <h1 id="accuracyByVolume">Accuracy By Volume</h1>
            <p>This option generates a list of tickets. Each possible number is distributed evenly between all tickets.</p>
            <h1 id="setOutcome">Set Outcome</h1>
            <p>This option uses the same winning number for all tickets. Generates new tickets each time</p>
            <h1 id="purelyRandom">Purely Random</h1>
            <p>This generates new random tickets, and a new winning number each time.</p>
            <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
            <p>In conclusion, this experiment was ultimately a failure.</p>
